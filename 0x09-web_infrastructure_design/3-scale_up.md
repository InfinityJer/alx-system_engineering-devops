# Reasoning for Additions:

**Load Balancer Cluster:** Ensures redundancy and failover in case one load balancer fails.

**Separate Web and Application Servers:** Allows each server type to scale independently based on demands

**1. Load Balancer Cluster for Redundancy and High Availability:**
A Load Balancer Cluster is used to ensure redundancy and high availability for your web infrastructure. In a single load balancer setup, if that load balancer goes down due to any reason, all incoming traffic would be affected. However, with a Load Balancer Cluster, if one load balancer fails, the other load balancer can take over the traffic distribution. This provides continuous service to users, minimizing downtime and disruptions.

**2. Separating Web and Application Servers for Better Scalability:**
By separating the Web Server (Nginx) and Application Server, we enable better scalability for our infrastructure. Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload or demand. Since web servers handle incoming user requests for static content like images and CSS, and application servers process dynamic requests like database queries and application logic, separating them allows us to scale each component independently. For example, during traffic spikes, we can scale out the application servers to handle more processing without affecting the web servers. This separation optimizes resource utilization and responsiveness.

**3. Benefits of Maintaining Separate MySQL Database Instances:**
Maintaining separate MySQL Database instances offers several benefits for our infrastructure. These benefits include:

* Performance: Separate instances allow databases to run on dedicated resources, optimizing performance for read and write operations.
* Isolation: If one database instance experiences issues or requires maintenance, it doesn't affect the others, ensuring better isolation and reliability.
* Scaling: As your application's data grows, you can scale each database instance individually, allocating more resources where needed.
* Load Distribution: Distributing database load across multiple instances helps prevent bottlenecks and ensures consistent database performance.
* Redundancy: If one database instance fails, others remain operational, minimizing downtime and data loss..
