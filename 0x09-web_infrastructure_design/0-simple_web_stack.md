Components and Explanations:

Server: A server is a computer system that hosts and provides services to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

Domain Name: A domain name is a human-readable label used to identify a website on the Internet. It provides an easier way to access resources hosted on servers.

DNS Record "www": The "www" in www.foobar.com is a subdomain, and in this context, it's a DNS (Domain Name System) record that points to a specific IP address. It's used to direct users to the web server.

Web Server (Nginx): A web server is software that processes incoming HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and serves the appropriate content. Nginx is a popular web server that can handle these requests efficiently.

Application Server: An application server is responsible for running the application's code and processing dynamic content. It communicates with the web server to serve dynamic web pages.

Application Files: These are the code and files that make up the website or web application. They include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.

Database (MySQL): A database is used to store structured data. MySQL is a relational database management system. It stores and retrieves data for the application to use.

Communication with User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol. The user's browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the appropriate HTML, CSS, and other assets needed to render the web page.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since there's only one server, if it fails, the entire website will become inaccessible.

Downtime during Maintenance: When performing maintenance (e.g., deploying new code), the web server needs to be restarted. This can cause downtime, making the website unavailable during that time.

Scalability: The current setup cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic. If the traffic spikes, the single server might become overloaded, leading to slow performance or crashes.
