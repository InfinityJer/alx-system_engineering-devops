# Additional Elements and Explanations:

**Firewalls:** Added to provide security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.

**SSL Certificate:** Added for serving traffic over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between users and the website.

**Monitoring:** Used to keep track of the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure.

## Explanations:

**Firewalls: **Firewalls control and filter network traffic, adding an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

**Traffic over HTTPS:** HTTPS encrypts data exchanged between users and the server, enhancing data privacy and security.

**Monitoring Purpose:** Monitoring helps detect issues, track performance, and ensure security.

**Monitoring Data Collection:** Monitoring clients collect data from various components and send it to the monitoring server for analysis.

**Monitoring Web Server QPS:**

To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), you would analyze incoming request data collected by the monitoring tool.
## Issues with the Infrastructure:

* SSL Termination at Load Balancer: SSL termination at the load balancer level exposes data to potential risks if not properly secured.
* Single MySQL Server for Writes: If the Primary MySQL server fails, write operations are affected.
* Uniform Server Components: If all servers have the same components, a single point of failure can impact the entire system.
